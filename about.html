            Home to the world's largest wine cellars, which ramble on for 200
            kilometers (124 miles), Milestii Mici also holds the country's
            national collection of wine, around 2 million bottles. The same
            collection was registered in 2005 with the Guinness World Records as
            the largest in the world. Today, it's most valuable wine is worth
            480 euros, but rest assured, Moldovans believe wine is for everyone.
            Plenty of bottles are priced very reasonably.

            The wine cellars of Cricova are the second largest wine cellar in
            Moldova, after Milestii Mici. Cricova Winery is a real underground
            wine city with wide streets, warehouses, and tasting rooms. Though
            an over-the-top underground oddity, the site was made a visiting
            point for all official delegations to the USSR and, even after its
            collapse, still holds the collections of various political
            heavyweights. Angela Merkel, John Kerry, Joe Biden, and Petro
            Poroshenko all visited and were gifted private collection spaces.
            Vladimir Putin has an impressive assortment of wines here, and,
            according to Forbes, a gold-plated mini-car to take him through the
            tunnels. While no politician, the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin,
            is rumored to have gotten lost in the caves for hours (guides like
            to joke that it was easier for him to get into space than out of the
            wine cellar).

            Purcari is one of the oldest wineries in Moldova, receiving its
            first gold medal in 1878 for a wine they still make today. Having
            entered more than 30 markets worldwide, Purcari might be the most
            easily-found Moldovan wine abroad. Located within its own
            micro-climate and receiving warm winds off the Black Sea, Purcari
            grapes ripen gently during summer days of sunshine across its hills
            on the 260-hectares of vines. Try the Negru de Purcari, the wine
            that won gold so many years ago.

            Castel Mimi is another massively important winery within Moldova, in
            part due to the stunning feats of architecture that the winery
            inhabits. Now restored, the winery preserves the collective memory
            of many through its tour which features snapshots of the winery's
            endurance through empires â€“ namely Russian, Romanian and Soviet
            rule.
