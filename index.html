      <p>
        Wine is at the heart of Moldovan life - even the shape of the country
        resembles a bunch of grapes dropped onto the map. Moldova has a little
        over 100,000 hectares of vines which actually means that the country has
        a bigger proportion of its land covered with vineyards than any other
        country. Moldova officially has
        <strong>the largest wine cellar in the world </strong>at Mile≈ütii Mici
        registered in the <em>Guinness World Records</em> with a collection of
        nearly two million bottles.
